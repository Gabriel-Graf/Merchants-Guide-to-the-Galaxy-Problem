# Merchants-Guide-to-the-Galaxy-Problem
This is a classic code-challenging task based on the "Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy" problem. During a job interview for a position as a Python developer, the following question was posed to me. The Classic Merchant's Guide to the Galaxy was modified to incorporate a blend of natural language, the Roman numeral system, and price calculation.

I was successful in my application for the position, and it is possible that this project may serve as a source of inspiration for other individuals.
